# WEB-GIT 

A simple Bash script to open github repos on github.com projects using aliases. 

## Features

- **Install (`--install`)**: Sets up the script by creating the mapping file (`.vscode_projects.json`) and adding an autocomplete function to your `.zshrc`. During installation, you'll be prompted to specify the initial GitHub root directory where your project folders are located.
- **Uninstall (`--uninstall`)**: Removes the mapping file and the autocomplete function from `.zshrc`.
- **Sync (`--sync`)**: Scans the specified GitHub root directory and updates the mapping file with any new project folders.
- **Open Projects**: Quickly open a project on GitHub in your default browser using its alias. The URL is read from the repositoryâ€™s `.git/config` (remote.origin.url), with error handling if missing.

## Usage

1. **Install the script**:
   ```bash
   web-git --install
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set up the mapping file and autocomplete.

2. **Uninstall the script**:
   ```bash
   web-git --uninstall
   ```

3. **Sync projects**:
   ```bash
   web-git --sync
   ```
   Updates the mapping file with new project folders from the GitHub root directory.

4. **Open a project**:
   ```bash
   web-git <project_alias>
   ```
   Opens the project associated with the given alias on github.com.

## Setup

1. Place the `web-git` script in a directory included in your `PATH`.

2. Run `web-git --install` to set up the script.

3. Run `web-git --sync` to populate the mapping file with existing project folders.

4. Use `web-git <project_alias>` to open projects by their aliases.

## Notes

- The mapping file (`.vscode_projects.json`) is stored in your home directory and contains project aliases, paths, and the GitHub root directory.
- You can manually edit the mapping file to add additional GitHub root directories or project aliases.
- Make sure you have `jq` installed for JSON manipulation.
